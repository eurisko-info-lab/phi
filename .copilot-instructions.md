# Copilot Instructions

## Terminal Rules

1. **Never use `/tmp`** - Always use `./tmp` instead for temporary files and operations.

2. **Server Terminal Reserved** - When a terminal is running the Phi server (`sbt "runMain phi.PhiServer"`), shown as `Terminal: java`, only use it for server stop/restart operations. All other commands must go to different terminals.

## File Locations

- Temporary files: `./tmp/`
- Playwright scripts: `./tmp/`
- Server logs: `./tmp/server.log`
